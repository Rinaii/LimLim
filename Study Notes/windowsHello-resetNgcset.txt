What ended up working for us:

Close all apps (or reboot and don't open anything)
Open elevated prompt
dsregcmd /cleanupaccounts
dsregcmd /leave
Delete all files inside %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Settings
Delete all files inside %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts
Reboot
After the reboot every client having WAM issues was able to re-enroll their device using the 'work and school accounts' section of settings.
